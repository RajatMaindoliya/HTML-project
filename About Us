	<h1> About Us</h1>

	<h2>How We Work</h2>

	  <p>
	  	“We help you help others” <br>
	  	
	  	<img src="walk2.jpeg" class="image2">
           We are a non-profit organisation that organizes walks for charity. 
           We will organise 4 walks per month (one every Sunday morning). The walks are an hour long. Each walk would be a different route so it is a new experience every time.<br>
           
           <br>
           
           The donations are made monthly. You will tell us which charity (4 options) you want to donate to this month at the first walk of the month. Your donation will be in cash at the end of the last walk of the month. At the start of each month, you can decide to either donate to the same charity as last month or go for a new one.<br>
           <br>

           There is also an option to add a charity of the walkers liking to the list of charities available.  All they need to need to do is email us about a charity they would like to donate to and if a good chunk of people would like to donate to that charity, we would happily add it to our list.
       </p>

	<h2>Services</h2>
	       <p>There will be two walk organisers each week who would lead the group walk. He/she would carry things like a bag of enough water bottles for each participant. They will also have a first aid kit with them on each walk. They will answer any questions you have or even if you just want someone to talk to!
	       </p>
           <p>Once a month, our personal photographer would accompany the walk and take great pictures of everyone without interrupting the walk. These pictures will be available for free at the end of the month and the best posers make it to the website’s page for the week! We also give put small badges. For example, you get a badge if you walk/donate for 3 months in a row…and then and even better one for 6 months in a row and so on!
           </p>
           <hr>

	<h2>Benefits</h2>
	    <p>You are not just donating to a good cause, you are helping yourself immensely during the process as we all know the huge number of benefits you get from walking. The walks are a great way to meet new people and socialize every week as there almost new faces joining every walk.
        </p>
     <hr>
	    <h2>Donations</h2>
	    <p>Monthly donations add up to 20 euro. 5 euro donations for every week. 
	    <br>Donations are directly sent to the chosen charities. You can find more about our charities by clicking <a href="Charities.html">here</a>
