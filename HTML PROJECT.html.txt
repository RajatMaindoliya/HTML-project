<p> There are many people, both young and old that don’t have access to the basic necessities. As Daily Meals we provide food essentials to those people in need. Our purpose is to end hunger by delivering hot meals.
The donations will allow us to purchase fresh groceries to aid in our mission of making a difference. Daily Meals have fed 1500 people throughout the whole of Ireland yearly with the cooperation of their 100 volunteers.
They released a new special Christmas programme which they introduced 2 years ago, which consists of the volunteers and their families having a Christmas Dinner with those in need of company and some heartwarming food to rekindle their
Christmas spirit. In the 2 years alone through this programme 1000 people have been fed warm welcoming meals and over €2500 was donated to Daily Meals to buy different neccessities for those in need.
